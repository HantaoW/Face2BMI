# Face2BMI

# Background

This is a project on predicting the Body Mass Index (BMI) solely from faces, instead of computing from weight and height. BMI = Weight(kg)/Height^2(m^2) It has been substantiated by numerous papers and journals that the BMI can be predicted from face, while there are many similar projects on the internet.
   
Underwriting could be one of the areas to which the model can be applied. For instance, life insurance company can classify the risk category of the insureds without the need of much information.  

This project is primarily inspired by papers, patent reports and open-sourced code done by other researchers. With insights gained from my practice added to this project, I should not say that my work is merely a stitch but hopefully a stepping-stone for successor researchers on this project.

# Process

There two types of data needed for this project, image data and tabular data, recording index(mapping to the image), sex, height, weight.
